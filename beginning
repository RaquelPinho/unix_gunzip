#first I created a directory where I downloaded the data into.
mkdir Data_RNAseq
#to remove a directory with is contents you can use rm -i -r directory
#second I created one directory for each lane in the illumina sequencing inside the Data_RNAseq directory
mkdir -p Data_RNAseq/RP{1..10}_demultiplexed #my data was already demultiplexed and I have 10 lanes
#you can also go to the Data_RNAseq directory and create the directories there ( cd Data_RNAseq ; mkdir RP{1..10}_demultiplexed)

#third you can download the data from the website using wget command
wget -o Data_RNAseq/RP1_demultiplex/index1L1.fastq.gz http/link_to_data_lane_1_index1 
#you can also go to the directory of that lane and just use wget http/link_to_data_lane_1_index1 and rename the files afterwards
#to rename the files afterward, in their directory type: rename 's/_S*.*/L1/' *  (for lane 1) the names were like this: 
#index2_S100_L006_R1_001.txt

#to do multiple downloads at the same time you can create multiple screens and download different files in each screen
#to create and name a new screen 
screen -S <name>
#to check if you are in the screen (echo $STY), to see the list of the screens (screen -list  or screen -ls)
#to detach the screen without closing it (screen -d <name>) to go back to a detached screen (screen -r <name>)
#to exit a screen for god, when you are inside the screen  (sometimes you have to type more than one)
exit
#to kill a screen 
screen -X -S [session # you want to kill] kill

#After you have all you data in the server in their respective directories, you can unzip them if you need.
#The majority of the softwares can handle .gz files, but I want to concatinate them again so I needed to decompress them.
#I have use a loop per lane (gunzip_loop.sh), but the command that I used was:
gunzip -c path/RP1_demultiplexed/${fname}_R1_001.fastq.gz > path/Unziped_files/RP1_demultiplexed/${fname}_R1_001.fastq
#this is a goos way to tell in each directory do you want the unziped file
#Now that you have the gunziped files you can concatenate them using the cat command:
cat index1L1.fastq index2L1.fastq ...> lane1.fastq
